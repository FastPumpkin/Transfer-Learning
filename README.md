# Transfer-Learning
Training specific classes using AlexNet 

You will need the weights of the Network, download them from here https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/.

The Training Set and Test Set folder contains images for training and testing. Here, I include some examples, but to really train there must be more.
